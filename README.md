# ScopusAPIs

This project has been developed to automatize the extraction of Scopus data (publications, affiliations, authors), using their RESTful APIs, in order to improve the quality and accuracy of the reports presented by the Scientometrics & Rankings and the Competitive Intelligence departments to the directors of Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, campus Monterrey.

Inside you will find the source code, as well as a binary file where all the neccessary libraries and python packages were packed, in case you just want to run the app and you do not want to install neither the python iterpreter nor the used packages.

It is important to mention that is necessary to have access to the Scopus DB in order to get the Key and also to download the desire information.
